  description: 'This book collects gestural plan and reflected ceiling plan drawings of imagined spaces which have been scanned and drawn over in a CAD environment. The individual drawings are made up of layers of graphite and printed ink, the latter tracing the former, creating effects of depth. Line weight and poch√©, applied in a the digital drawing environemnt contribute to a compositional strengthening of gestural line. A conceptual "found condition" in the graphite line is surveyed and stabilized by the CAD line.',
