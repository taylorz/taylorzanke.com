    title: 'The Sopron Story: Looking back 60 years later',
    publication: 'UBC NOW',
    datePublished: 'September 23, 2018',
    statement: 'I was tasked with researching and reporting the 1956 exodus of 200 forestry students from the town of Sopron, Hungary, during the Hungarian Revolution. These students were offered refuge at the University of British Columbia, where they continued their studies. The goal of this article was to inform and remember these remarkable students 60 years after their immigration.',
    excerpt: 'Chances are, you know someone who has immigrated to Canada from another part of the world. Whether this person is your grandmother, your father or your friend — you’ve likely heard an immigrant’s tale of persistence and incredible risk, one in which they left everything behind in the hopes of finding a haven from conflict or a place for their descendants to thrive.',
    marginNotes: {
      first: 'This first sentence is designed to hook the reader in by using the second person POV and providing a possible personal connection to the story. ',
      second: 'The em dash is inserted in this sentence instead of a comma. The dash allows the reader a full breath to absorb the statement and feel the emphasis on the following phrase.',
      third: 'I finish the introduction with the idea of immigration as a form of safety, signalling to the reader this will be the core theme of the article.'

    title: 'What Are You Working On? with Nicole Barrett',
    publication: 'UBC.ca',
    datePublished: 'September, 2016',
    statement: 'I interviewed Nicole Barrett, the director of the International Justice and Human Rights Clinic at The Peter A. Allard School of Law. This interview was part of a web series that focused on the innovative work of faculty and staff at UBC.',
    excerpt: 'Her career has been a whirlwind of remarkable experiences. Her devotion to the rule of law has taken her across the globe. She’s been a trial lawyer and legal officer at the Yugoslav Tribunal in The Hague and was a law advisor for the defense of Guantanamo Bay detainees. She worked on the National Task Force on the Trafficking of Women and Girls in Canada. Through all these experiences she has remained sincere and indefatigable.',
    marginNotes: {
      first: 'In this paragraph I give the reader a taste of the type of work Nicole does. Phrases like “whirlwind” and “across the globe,” add movement to her actions and signal to the reader the breadth of her experience.',
      second: 'Instead of listing her experience in a long list, I chose to break her most important achievements into separate clauses. This makes the sentence structure more interesting and easier to absorb.',
      third: 'The last sentence acts as conclusion and transition. It describes how Nicole tackled her job, but also hints at further explanation to come.'

    title: 'Life’s Bizarre Realities: A Review of Stephanie Warner’s A Violent Streak',
    publication: 'Prism International',
    datePublished: 'February 21, 2019',
    statement: 'I wrote this book review on Stephanie Warner’s debut poetry collection for PRISM International. The intention was to summarize the collection and also cultivate interest in her work.',
    excerpt: 'In this collection, forty poems coalesce to form a portrait of the increasingly strange world we find ourselves in. Warner juxtaposes disparate elements such as creation and destruction, industry and nature, and the physical and abstract. This results in uncanny coexistences that feel familiar, yet absurd.',
    marginNotes: {
      first: 'The use of the adverb “increasingly” gives the subject matter urgency.',
      second: 'I highlighted six elements in Warner’s work and placed them in a side-by-side comparison. The elements organized like this on the page provide the reader with thematic reference points while they read the book review.',
      third: 'The final sentence addresses the question all writers ask themselves – so what? I outline the thesis of my article and what I believe is the major impetus of Warner’s work.'
