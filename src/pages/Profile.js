        <Text p>Hello, Iâ€™m Taylor, a Canadian artist and designer based in Los Angeles, California. I'm a partner at Little Universe, a digital agency building products alongside clients of all sizes to help solve the climate crisis. I co-founded Figure Press, where I collaborate with artists and designers on books, bringing delicate new ideas to form. I also maintain my own small, independent office where I focus on self directed projects with an evolving set of concerns and requirements relating to architecture, graphic design, and art.</Text>
