      <p>In my art making all works are temporary. The shape of my practice is defined by a cyclical making and un-making of works in which material is recycled, repeated, and reshaped. Works hang together, then dissipate, yielding new works. My work is simultaneously complete and incomplete, ongoing and still, a part and a whole.</p>
      <p>It is important that the material which composes my works is recognizable: known forms which compose a familiar world. My work seeks to access and address potentially shared impressions, inner lives, and experiences which are imbued by all into familiar surroundings. Found and created ephemera exist together, building a bridge between my own life, the life of the work, and the lives of others.</p>
      <p>A principle which guides my practice is the importance of the physical occupation of space. The spatial quality of works, which accumulate and are organized, press on the shape of the mundane and allow it to be recast. An enduring project in my practice is in the reshaping of the familiar by guiding the accretion of living work.</p>
      <p>Though cyclical, the making of my works does not smooth out into gradation. Moments of transition are precious, punctuating, and construct the history of the materials which compose my work. Continuity is preserved and non-linearity is developed, narrative is encountered in change.</p>
      <p>I strive for my work to be discovered as a part of the banal, indistinct from it, conceding to its patterns. In my practice the delicate relationship between commonplace and unusual is a key site of effort: one which I strive to expand and stabilize. Any viewer of my work is a collaborator in this attempt.</p>
