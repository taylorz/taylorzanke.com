      <p>I am an artist and designer building products at <a href="https://tend.build/">Tend</a> and making art through my personal practice, <a href="https://allowingmanyforms.com">AMF</a>.</p>
      <p>I'm interested in systems, workflows, and cycles of action.</p>
      <p>I graduated from Parsons the New School for Design with a BFA in Design and Technology, and from Columbia University with a Master of Architecture and M.S. in Real Estate Development.</p>
