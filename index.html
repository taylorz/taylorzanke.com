          <p>Taylor Zanke (b. 1992, Canada) is an artist and designer based in Los Angeles, USA. In addition to his studio practice, he is the founding director of <a href="https://allowingmanyforms.org/" target="_blank">Allowing Many Forms</a>, an art book publisher, artist residency program, and multiform design studio.</p>
          <p>Through site-specific installations, sculpture, and drawings, Taylor investigates the distinction between the everyday and the artwork. By incorporating materials sourced from his immediate environment into his works he questions the semiotics of the ordinary and proposes new meanings and associations between familiar, even ubiquitous, objects and forms.</p>
          <p>In his practice, Taylor is interested in the ways that works slow into form through a process of accretion. His work raises questions about its own fixedness, and in doing so suggests the same questioning might extend to the presumably rooted structures and norms which surround us.</p>
          <p>Taylor is trained as an architect. In a past life he was co-founder of a product design and engineering agency serving non-profits and e-commerce brands. He holds degrees in design, architecture, and real estate finance from Parsons the New School for Design and Columbia University.</p>
